        "content": "The ocean and the sky both appear blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Rayleigh scattering occurs when the molecules in the Earth's atmosphere scatter the shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) more than the longer wavelengths (red and orange).\n\nWhen sunlight passes through the Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with the molecules in the air, such as oxygen and nitrogen. The shorter blue and violet wavelengths of light are dispersed more widely in all directions by these smaller molecules compared to the longer red and orange wavelengths.\n\nIn the case of the ocean, when sunlight reaches the surface, the water acts as a reflective medium. The water molecules absorb the longer wavelengths of light (red, orange, and yellow) more strongly, while reflecting and scattering the shorter wavelengths (blue and green) back to our eyes.\n\nThis scattering of shorter wavelengths is what makes the ocean and the sky appear blue to us. The blue color dominates as it is being scattered and reflected more efficiently than other colors by the particles in the atmosphere and the water.\n\nIt is worth noting that the color of the ocean and the sky can vary due to different factors such as variations in atmospheric conditions, the presence of other particles or substances in the water, and the angle at which sunlight reaches our eyes.",
